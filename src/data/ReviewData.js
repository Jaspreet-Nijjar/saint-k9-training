    review:
      'Absolutely amazing, I fully trust Kate with Albert. His recall has improved and his more of a pleasure to walk after Kate‚Äôs training with him. He loves his regular walks and training  with Kate, he comes back tired out and sleeps all afternoon. He loves Kate and is always so excited to see her. Best decision I‚Äôve made having Kate as a regular part of his routine. Thank you!',

    review:
      'We couldn‚Äôt recommend Kate more! We met for a training session with our Labrador Rosie, to work on her loose lead walking. Kate educated us on where we were going wrong, and had Rosie walking to heel within the first half an hour. We now have some invaluable exercises to practice going forward, and we feel confident that we can nail this now. Kate‚Äôs knowledge is second to none and we would have no hesitation in recommending her to anyone who is looking for a fantastic and professional dog trainer. Thank you Kate!',

      "Kate, is incredible she is working miracles with our doberman Cole and us haha. Updates us all the way after every walk and train with pictures. Honestly don‚Äôt know what we would have done if I hadn‚Äôt found Kate. üê∂üêæ  Its helped us massively & progressed Cole‚Äôs training to the next level. Can‚Äôt wait to see what he is like in a few months!I couldn't recommend her enough! xx",
